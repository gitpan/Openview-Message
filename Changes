	- Documentation cleanup
   - Look at the OV/lib dir to determine the available libraries 
     with which to link
   - Provide CLI wrapper implementation for those cases where we cannot link
     with the library, but CLI is available.
     This can also be used with the CLI_OPENVIEW_SENDER
     evironment VAR to force the use of the CLI in forking servers
     which would be trashed by the fact that the OV libraries
     "are not fork safe".
